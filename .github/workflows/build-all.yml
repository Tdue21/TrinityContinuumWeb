        # The desired behavior if no files are found using the provided path.
        # Available Options:
        # - warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
        # - error: Fail the action with an error message
        # - ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail
        # if-no-files-found: # optional, default is warn

        # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
        # Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.
        retention-days: 2 # optional

        # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.
        # compression-level: # optional, default is 6

        # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.
        overwrite: true # optional, default is false

        # If true, hidden files will be included in the artifact. If false, hidden files will be excluded from the artifact.
        # include-hidden-files: # optional, default is false
